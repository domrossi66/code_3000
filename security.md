The intended users of this repo are Dominic Rossi (me) and the graders of my work.

There is not a large security risk if this repo falls into the wrong hands. The worst consequence is the hacker could upload work that makes me fail the class.

To secure the repo I have created a ruleset that does not allow deletions or force pushes to the repository by anyone but myself.
